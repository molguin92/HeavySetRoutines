Linear progression.
Start with a weight you can comfortably do all sets with while leaving 3 or 4 repetitions in the tank after each set.
Then, increase weight every workout by 5kg for lower body exercises (squat, deadlift, etc), and 2.5kg for upper body exercises (overhead/bench press, etc).
Once you fail a set of 6, try to finish that day with the same weight, but next time lower the weight by 20% - 25% and repeat progression.
